        Problem Statement
    </h1>

    <h3 style="color: white; font-size:medium; text-align: center;">Introduction</h3>
    <p style="color: white; font-size:medium;">
        Pad printing is a versatile printing process that involves transferring an image or design from an etched plate to a three-dimensional
         object using a silicone pad as an intermediary. It is commonly employed to apply graphics, logos, and text to various materials and
          surfaces, including plastics, metals, ceramics, and glass. At Cadence, the traditional pad printer with a single applicator was
           initially used, but it was recently replaced with the 200-PS 2-color pad printer, aiming to improve printing efficiency and quality.
            However, several challenges have arisen with this transition, hindering the process's effectiveness and necessitating improvements.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: white; font-size:medium; text-align: center;">Problems</h3>
    <p style="color: white; font-size:medium; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
        Incomplete or Blurry Stryker Logo Application: After adopting the 200-PS 2-color pad printer, the application of the Stryker logo on
         products exhibited issues with completeness and clarity. Portions of the logo were often not fully transferred, resulting in an 
         unprofessional appearance. Additionally, some imprints appeared thick and blurry, compromising the overall product aesthetics. </p>
         <p style="color: white; font-size:medium; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
          Frequent Applicator Cleaning Requirement: The new pad printing equipment necessitates frequent cleaning of the applicator. This
           frequent maintenance disrupts the workflow and decreases overall productivity. Efficiency is further compromised as valuable working 
           hours are devoted to cleaning, rather than focusing on printing tasks. </p>
           <p style="color: white; font-size:medium; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
           "Double Vision" on One Side of Print: An irregularity known as
            "double vision" occurs on one side of the printed images. This anomaly results in a distorted replication of the intended design and
             significantly diminishes the overall quality of the printed products. </p>
             <p style="color: white; font-size:medium; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
              Inability to Simultaneously Print and Plastic Injection Mold Parts: A significant issue that arises with the new 200-PS 2-color pad printer is its incompatibility with simultaneously pad 
              printing and plastic injection molding parts. The inability to multitask these operations hampers production efficiency and causes
               undue delays in the overall manufacturing process. </p>
               <p style="color: white; font-size:medium; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
               Sequential Printing of Stryker Part Sides: With the previous single-applicator
                pad printer, both sides of the Stryker parts could be printed simultaneously. However, with the 200-PS 2-color pad printer, printing
                 one side of the Stryker parts at a time has become necessary, resulting in a slower production rate and subsequently increasing
                  the overall lead time.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: white; font-size:medium; text-align: center;">Objective</h3>
    <p style="color: white; font-size:medium;">
        The purpose of this problem statement is to address the aforementioned challenges encountered in the history of pad printing at Cadence.
         By identifying these issues, I am seeking to find viable solutions and improvements to enhance the efficiency, quality, and productivity 
         of the pad printing process using the 200-PS 2-color pad printer. Through implementing suitable remedies, I aim to achieve consistent, 
         high-quality pad prints and streamline the printing process to optimize production timelines and reduce operational interruptions.
